    "comment": "With my experience as a user, only get a gaming laptop if you already have a gaming pc at home and you need a gaming laptop if you are playing heavy games for an hour or 2 max. Also be prepared to get it repasted with the best most expensive paste by a professional every 4 to 6 months. I had an Alienware PC custom built for about &amp; 7000 for a few years, then when i was upgrading, i decided to get an Asus Zephyrus top of the line at the time for $4300. The PC was a GTX i7 16 GB, and the Laptop was an RTX 3060ti i7 32 gb, i mainly played Destiny 2, Forza and Microsoft Flight Sim and boy it would get super hot. After about 5 months, as soon as I would launch any games for about 15 mins the fan would start, i had no idea that the paste inside was already rock solid.. It went like that for about 1 year, i thought there was something wrong with windows updates or malware or something.. Refreshed the laptop, then reinstalled everything fresh, was still getting loud noise and frames drop in games.. And boom one day it died.. Then i brought it to a technician and when they opened it everything was fried.. Because apparently my paste was rock solid.. The guy tood me that with gaming laptop i needed to bring it every 4 to 6 months if I wanted to keep it for a few years..",

I contacted the support and they said that it&#39;s okay, but I think it&#39;s not and that the battery could last longer. The laptop didn&#39;t overheat, but Edge and Chrome draw a lot of energy. The previous laptop (Inspiron 7567) can last up to 5 hours after 3 years for 5 tabs and certain programs included. Any advice?",

It weighs 5.3 pounds for the GeForce 3050 Ti and 3060 and 6 pounds for the higher GPUs. Even with higher GPU it only weighs 1.2 pounds heavier than the much thinner MacBook Pro.  Also I wouldn\u2019t get the i9 version. It\u2019s the same exact cpu as i7 just with 500MHz more speed which is not worth the cost difference. The Mobile GeForce 3070 TI is the same GPU as the Mobile GeForce 3080Ti just with higher clock speed and double the video memory. Just note that Double the video ram doesn\u2019t improve graphics all that much. Many people confuse the performance gains of increased System RAM and Video RAM.  This is why GPUs such as the desktop GeForce 1060 3GB can well outperform a GeForce 1050 Ti with 4GB of video memory. I personally don\u2019t think the 500 dollar difference is worth the cost for minimal real world performance boost.",

    "comment": "I snagged this on sale, like new condition from the Dell Outlet. It was $1720 for these specs but with the 240hz 1440p screen. I thought there was another 15% off coupon that I could add but it was for different model which made me reconsider... Decided to talk to a sales rep and I must have been extra nice because he ended up giving me a 15% discount as an exception on top of it. $1462 total so I&#39;m pretty psyched despite me not being an Alienware fan in general!",
