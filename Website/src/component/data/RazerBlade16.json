It\u2019s passable in game, but the UI when navigating Windows doesn\u2019t look good.  Considering how excellent the display looks in 4k, I would bet most people will set it there and rarely use the FHD+ option. Sorry I missed that in the video!",

Overall, your work is excellent, and I encourage you to keep it up.\r\rI have a suggestion for a future video topic: a comparison between the ROG Zephyrus M16 (2023) and the Razer Blade 16 (2023 - 4080 GPU model). I would be very interested in hearing your verdict on these devices, particularly regarding whether the Razer Blade is worth the significant price difference. A comparison video would be truly valuable. Thank you\u270c",

My biggest issues are the price (WHAT was I thinking.....) and lack of ethernet port. There&#39;s no excuse for leaving that out IMO. I&#39;m coming from a 2021 Asus Zephyrus G15 and the ethernet port was extremely handy in many work situations. Having to use a dongle is not the end of the world, but for the price and the size of this machine, it should have one. I put a dbrand skin on it, which I&#39;m liking a lot. I&#39;ve just ordered a couple pf 2TB SSDs so I&#39;ll be upgrading  the storage shortly.",

    "comment": "I\u00b4ve owned two Razer Blade laptops before, namely, the 2019 13-inch (GTX) and the 15-inch advanced 2021 and I can wholeheartedly say that I have never had a more frustrating, money-wasting experience than purchasing a Razer laptop.  They are a perfect example of how expensive laptops do not equal quality, longevity, or a worthwhile experience. They run hot and the batteries bloat, regardless, of how well you take care of the laptops. The Synapse software is incredibly buggy and I can&#39;t recommend enough for people to stay away from Razer laptops. DO NOT GET FOOLED BY THE BEAUTIFUL EXTERIOR; THEY ARE ROTTEN TO THE CORE!",
