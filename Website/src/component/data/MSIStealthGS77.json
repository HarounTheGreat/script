    "comment": "I&#39;ve had the GS77 for about 4 months now and I think it&#39;s pretty terrible in a lot of ways. When first setting it up my laptop crashed due to high temperature. The automatic feature for the fan attempts to keep the fan fairly quiet, but you will have to set the fan setting to &quot;Cooler Boost&quot; if you want to pay any games at a decent setting. There is nothing stealthy about this laptop if you want to do anything more then watch videos on it. It runs extremely hot. It is actually extremely loud while on &quot;Cooler Boost&quot;. Without &quot;Cooler Boost&quot; you will feel great travel to the keyboard keys within ten minutes while paying any demanding game.Video quality is significantly worse than my previous Gamer&#39;s Republic G5. 1080p does not look like 1080p. It&#39;s as if the picture was designed for a smaller resolution, then they decided to stretch that same picture on a larger screen.I had trouble connecting my expensive Razer headphones to this laptop which I hadn&#39;t experienced with a gaming laptop, especially since my headphones are wired. Long story short I had to deep dive into the audio settings and disable an MSI audio program which was automatically competing with my headphones.Would not recommend.",

    "comment": "The problem with the thin and light Stealth is that its barely any thinner and not really any lighter than the G77.  The only reason I picked the GS77 over the G77hx was because the mousepad is where it&#39;s supposed to be.  The mousepad on the Raider is sitting almost all the way to the left of the laptop... So your hand sits on it no matter where you place your hand on the keys.  We need to get rid of mouse pads on gamers &gt;&lt;",

    "comment": "I would stay away from MSI. They are a horrible company. I purchased a GS76 Stealth 11UH-029 17.3\u201d FHD Gaming Laptop with Extended Warranty - 2 Years for $3,239.99. The laptop broke by fault of MSI hardware within 7 months of owning it and I had to send it in for a repair. When they repaired it, they caused another problem with the licensure of Windows and I had to redownload all the drivers manually with MSI on the phone. Another hardware problem came up and I had to send it in for a repair again. I have been without this laptop for over three months. Bernabe Nunez is very unresponsive and they will not give me a refund. Finally, they shipped it to the wrong location and guaranteed me an extension on my warranty and have failed to follow through. STAY FAR AWAY FROM MSI. I hope my accurate review will spare anyone else the extreme frustration MSI has caused me.",

There are things that MSI does to be good overall. My biggest gripe is the downfiring speakers, they are trash for my situation. The grill on top is also key for my situation.

It use to be just size + cooling being the biggest limitation with the 20 series gpus.  Now it seems like the biggest limitation is the max amount of wattage it has which has a domino effect on other compartments of the device.  I dont see the point in getting a 3070ti laptop if you&#39;re so limited to the amount of power you can use. If this laptop had 20 more watts to it then you&#39;re looking at almost 20 fps more and 20fps difference is insane",

I don&#39;t want to buy a laptop to game on since I am used to keyboard, mouse etc and I have a setup that I use for work that I game on. So the obvious chose is to buy a desktop, but the desktop market its really weird at the moment the graphics card cost a fortune and it is hard to get. Then I need to spend hour to build and maintain the system and don&#39;t want a fulltower I want as small form factor as possible.So here is the ide :D  wouldn&#39;t be nice I you could buy a gaming laptop without the screen battery and keyboard so basically a NUC with laptop components. The thermal could be perfect since the size is not an issue and you have unlimited power. Have you heard about this typ of system?",

What I don&#39;t like it for is the extremely poor camera,  very poor audio output, and very uncomfortable keyboard (they just adapted the US layout to EU, which is a bad idea).  The brick of a power supply and the HDMI port hardwired to NVIDIA graphics do not help as well. I use it as a mobile AI station when I am on the move, but I have to carry a keyboard and webcam, and I replaced the power supply with a lighter GaN one. Also, I am forced to use a USB-C to HDMI converter.",

I hear they\u2019re coming with the new Ryzen Zen 3D architectures with the new Radeon GPUs. I\u2019ll always want to go for a system with similar performance or slightly lower with a much lower power draw! @Dave2D it\u2019d be really kind of you to do a comparison video between the MSI Z16P and the LENOVO Z16. Thanks.",

I bought the GS65 specially because it was lighter than the competition as I travel a lot, and was happy with the mild trade off of a slightly flexible chassis. I also thought the GS65 looked way nicer than this GS77 design with the back end sticking out. I guess it&#39;s all subjective.",

I&#39;m currently rocking an XPS 17, so I don&#39;t really have any need or desire to upgrade right now, but I&#39;d buy the Z16 in a heartbeat if I was in the market for a new machine. The machined aluminum chassis with the 16:10 glossy display is just absolute perfection, which is why I bought my XPS in the first place. I honestly don&#39;t think I could ever get a laptop without those features anymore. Plus two SSD slots is a must for upgradability purposes.",

The only concern I have is the battery life, an average of 3 and a half hours isn&#39;t bad, but isn&#39;t great at all when compared to so many others.. And I heard someone complain about the hinge of MSI Z series, that&#39;s the exact same issue I have now with my Lenovo Yoga 730.. Hinge is gone, laptop is stationary, and I spent a lot getting it... Now I just can&#39;t move it. I&#39;ve been having issues finding who can fix it here, haven&#39;t found anyone yet. That said, I&#39;ll keep an eye on the Z16P... I think I might get it in the future if my pocket allows me.. More light on it Dave, maybe after some extra use if possible. Thanks man and great video \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf",
