    "comment": "#NO CHEAP AND  STILL THE MOST TERRIBLE PRODUCT : LENOVO LAPTOP THE WORST, DO NOT BUY ONE, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY. GET OVERHEAT EASY, FROZEN FREQUENTLY, DISCONNECT ITSELF FROM WIFFI, STOP WORKING EVEN AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS OUSTIDE THE STORE, THE BATTERY LIFE IS HORRIBLE, ONLY 1 TO 11/2 HOUR EVEN IF YOU USE THE LAPTOP FOR BASIC WORK, AFTER 5 MOHTS MUST BE PERMANENTLY PLUGGED TO THE ELECTRIC LINE. LAPTOP WOULD STOP WORKING AFTER 6 MONTHS BEING BOUGHT.  NO REFUND EVEN THOUGHT AFTER THE  ITEM HAS COME DEFECTUOSO FROM THE MANUFACTURE.  LENOVO IS  A GARBAGE PRODUCT, EVEN IF THE LAPTOP IS UNDER GUARANTY , THE GUARANTY DOES NOT COVER ANYTHING, AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ALSO THE WORST. WASTE OF 1500 US DOLLAR. IF ANYONE WILL SPENT MORE THAT A 1000 DOLLARS ON A LAPTOP THIS MUST A LEAST WORK FOR MORE THAN 3 YEARS. AGAIN DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ACQUIRING A LENOVO PRODUCT, THE WORST LAPTOP AND PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET",

They would be the same color. Well, I no longer have that laptop and got a Lenovo. If I googled said cat, the picture&#39;s color would look different on my lenovo than it did on my iphone and previous type of laptop: less saturated on the new computer, I would say. By any chance, am I able to change my lenovo&#39;s color to be that of a thinkpad?",
